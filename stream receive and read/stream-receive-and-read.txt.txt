Here, we have a input stream of data eg: "I am a programmer"
we can use a data structure like "vector<pair<int, vector<char> v> vec" to solve this problem,
here first value of the pair will store the chunk number and the second value, that is, the vector of type 
char will be used to store the bytes of incoming stream data corresponding to every chunk number,
then using this concept, we can receive our chunk in any order and then when user calls the read function to 
read the stream of data that came in, we can sort our "vector<pair<int, vector<char> v> vec" using the 
first value of pair, that is, the chunk number, (using sort() function which will take nlogn time 
to sort the whole data) and then corresponding to every chunk number after sorting it, we can 
display(cout or print) the stream of data that we stored in out vector of char type.

after sorting we can access our data using a for loop like
for(auto &x: vec){
    here we can print our stream of data
    while(x.second.size()>0)
    ans += x.second.v[index of every element of vector of char]
    
}
cout<<ans<<"\n";
